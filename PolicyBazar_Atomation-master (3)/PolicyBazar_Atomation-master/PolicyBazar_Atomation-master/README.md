# Policybazaar Automation Suite üöÄ

## Project Overview

This project is a robust automated testing suite designed to interact with the **Policybazaar.com** website. It automates key insurance-related scenarios, demonstrating advanced web automation techniques. The suite is built with **Selenium WebDriver** in **Java**, leverages **WebDriverManager** for seamless browser driver management, adopts the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern for highly maintainable and scalable tests, and utilizes **Cucumber BDD Framework** with **TestNG** for structured, readable, and executable specifications.

-----

## Problem Statements / Automation Scenarios

This automation suite addresses the following specific scenarios on Policybazaar.com, defined as Gherkin features:

1.  ### Find Travel Insurance Plan for Students ‚úàÔ∏è

      * **Objective:** Automate the process of finding international travel insurance plans specifically for students.
      * **Feature File:** `TravelInsurance.feature`
      * **Details:** The automation, driven by `TravelInsuranceSteps.java` and using the `TravelInsurance_Page` object, navigates to the travel insurance section, enters a destination country (e.g., **"France"**), selects specific travel dates (e.g., **August 1, 2025 - August 20, 2025**), and specifies **2 student travelers (aged 21 and 22)** with no pre-existing diseases. It then proceeds to view available plans.
      * **Output:** The script is designed to **display the three lowest-priced international travel insurance plans**, including their respective **amounts and insurance provider companies** (this display logic would be implemented in subsequent steps not yet provided but expected within the same scenario).

2.  ### Get a Car Insurance Quote (Error Handling Validation) üöó

      * **Objective:** Automate the process of getting a car insurance quote while specifically testing error handling for invalid inputs.
      * **Feature File:** `CarInsurance.feature`
      * **Details:** The script, driven by `CarInsuranceSteps.java`, navigates to the car insurance page. It then simulates a user proceeding without entering a car number, followed by selecting the city, car brand, car model, fuel type, and variant. Finally, it attempts to submit user details with a username ("John Doe") and an **invalid mobile number ("87676788")** obtained from the `config.properties` file.
      * **Output:** The automation captures the error message displayed for the invalid mobile number field and **asserts that it contains the substring "valid"**, demonstrating robust error handling capabilities for invalid data entry.

3.  ### Retrieve Health Insurance Menu Items üè•

      * **Objective:** Automate the extraction of all health insurance menu items from the Policybazaar website.
      * **Feature File:** `MedicalInsurance.feature`
      * **Details:** The script, driven by `MedicalInsuranceSteps.java` and using the `MedicalInsurancePage` object, navigates to the "View all products" section (which acts as the entry point to list medical options). It then fetches all listed medical insurance options.
      * **Output:** The automation **asserts that more than zero options are found** and then **prints all fetched medical insurance options to the console** for verification.

-----

## Key Automation Scope

The project employs and demonstrates proficiency in the following core web automation techniques:

  * **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):** Structured tests written in human-readable Gherkin syntax (defined in `.feature` files), executed by Cucumber, enhancing collaboration and understanding between technical and non-technical stakeholders.
  * **Browser Management:** Dynamic initialization and management of Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers using **WebDriverManager** (`BaseBrowserSetup`).
  * **Page Object Model (POM):** Extensively implemented for structured, reusable, and highly maintainable test code across `BaseBrowserSetup`, `CarInsurance_Page`, `MedicalInsurancePage`, and `TravelInsurance_Page`.
  * **Cucumber Hooks:** Intelligent utilization of `@Before` and `@After` annotations with **tags** in step definition classes (e.g., `CarInsuranceSteps`, `MedicalInsuranceSteps`, `TravelInsuranceSteps`) for setting up and tearing down browser instances **per scenario or group of scenarios**. This ensures test isolation and efficient resource management.
  * **External Configuration Management:** Reading test data and configuration values (like invalid mobile numbers) from external property files using a `ConfigReader.java` utility, promoting flexibility and easy data management.
  * **Explicit Waits:** Robust use of `WebDriverWait` and `ExpectedConditions` to handle dynamic page loads, asynchronous operations, and ensure elements are present, visible, or clickable before interaction.
  * **JavaScript Executor:** Employed for advanced UI interactions, including scrolling elements into view (`scrollToElement`), visually highlighting elements during execution (`highlightElement` for debugging/demonstration), and performing clicks on elements that might be otherwise intercepted by other elements (`jsClick`).
  * **Actions Class:** Used for performing complex user interactions such as `moveToElement` for hovering or ensuring elements are in the viewport.
  * **Robust Click Handling:** Custom `waitAndClick` methods to handle common Selenium exceptions like `ElementClickInterceptedException` by gracefully falling back to JavaScript clicks, enhancing test reliability.
  * **Form Filling & Interaction:** Automation of filling various web form fields, including text inputs, selecting options from dropdowns, and interacting with date pickers.
  * **Error Message Capture & Validation:** Identifying and extracting warning/error messages displayed on the UI for assertion using TestNG's `Assert.assertTrue`, vital for negative test scenarios.
  * **Data Extraction & Collection:** Retrieving specific data points (e.g., insurance plan details, menu items) from web pages and storing them efficiently in Java collections (`ArrayList`, `List`).
  * **Dynamic Element Interaction:** Handling dynamically loaded or changing UI elements effectively.
  * **Test Tagging:** Strategic usage of Cucumber tags (e.g., `@Smoke`, `@MedicalInsurance`, `@TravelInsurance`, `@CarInsurance`) for selective test execution, enabling flexible regression and sanity testing.
  * **Comprehensive Test Reporting:** Generation of multiple report types including standard HTML, JSON, and rich graphical reports via ExtentReports, providing detailed insights into test execution status.
  * **Rerun Capability:** Configuration to generate a `failed_scenarios.txt` file, enabling efficient re-execution of only failed tests.

## Setup and Installation

To get this project running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  ### Prerequisites

      * **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Ensure you have **JDK 11 or higher** installed. You can download it from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or use OpenJDK.
      * **Apache Maven:** This project is built with Maven. Download and install Maven from [Apache Maven's official website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
      * **Internet Connection:** Required for WebDriverManager to automatically download browser drivers the first time they are needed.

2.  ### Clone the Repository

    Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

    ```bash
    git clone 
    cd PolicyBazar_Automation
    ```

3.  ### Install Dependencies

    Navigate to the project's root directory (where your `pom.xml` file is located) and run the Maven command to download all necessary dependencies and compile the project:

    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

    Browser drivers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) are automatically managed and downloaded by WebDriverManager at runtime when `BaseBrowserSetup.initializeBrowser` is called.

4.  ### Configure Test Data

      * The project utilizes a `ConfigReader` utility to fetch test data and settings from a **`config.properties`** file.
      * This file should be located under `src/test/resources`.
      * Example content for `config.properties`:
        ```properties
        # Car Insurance Test Data
        car.insurance.username=John Doe
        car.insurance.invalid.mobile=87676788
        ```
      * *Ensure the actual values in your `config.properties` match your testing requirements.*

-----

## How to Run

After completing the setup, you can execute the automation tests:

1.  **Ensure all prerequisites and installation steps are complete.**

2.  **Open your IDE** (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) and import the Maven project.

3.  **Run the tests:**
    The primary way to run tests is via the **`TestRunner.java`** class, which acts as the entry point for Cucumber.

      * **From IDE:**
          * Navigate to `src/test/java/com/policybazaar/runners/TestRunner.java`.
          * Right-click on `TestRunner.java` and select "Run 'TestRunner'".
          * This will execute all scenarios tagged with `@Smoke` (or whatever tag is specified in `TestRunner.java`). Note that `@Before` and `@After` hooks with specific tags (e.g., `@TravelInsurance`) will ensure the correct browser setup and teardown for relevant scenarios.
      * **Via Maven Command Line:**
        ```bash
        mvn test
        ```
        This command will execute all tests defined by the `TestRunner.java` class, respecting its `@CucumberOptions` configuration (e.g., running scenarios tagged `@Smoke`). The `maven-surefire-plugin` is configured to include `**/*Runner.java` for execution.

4.  **Observe the browser automation** as it navigates through Policybazaar.com. You will see elements being **highlighted in red** as the automation interacts with them, providing visual feedback.

5.  **Check the console output** for displayed information such as:

      * Messages indicating successful navigation and interactions.
      * The three lowest travel insurance plan details (if implemented in the Gherkin scenario and step definitions).
      * Captured car insurance error messages (along with assertion results).
      * The list of health insurance menu items.
